/*****************************************************
 * This is a hello world sample of webhook implementation
 * for a SAP Conversation Bot with a webhook trigger as 
 * action. This simple sample how you reply with text 
 * message and a list template message. The nlp result by 
 * SAP Conversational AI is sent in the request body, in
 * which you can know about the intent and entities etc as 
 * a result of your bot training. Before reply to user, 
 * a service fulfilment should be accomplished according to 
 * the intent.
 * 
 * For example, the end user is buying something through 
 * a conversation with your bot, once the intent and given 
 * contextual information has been understood by the bot,
 * it fulfils the service by invoking a RESTful call to 
 * SAP Business One or SAP Business ByDesign to place an order 
 * etc, and respond to the end user with the order number 
 * just placed.
